# Staging Environment Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Kainos Studio staging environment.

## üéØ Overview

The staging environment is designed for:
- Integration testing and validation
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Performance testing
- Pre-production validation
- Stakeholder demonstrations

## üìã Prerequisites

- Completed development environment setup
- All development tests passing
- Security scans completed successfully
- Stakeholder approval for staging deployment

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare for Staging Deployment

Ensure your changes are merged to the main branch:
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Verify clean state
git status
```

### 2. Navigate to Provider Directory

#### For AWS Staging
```bash
cd aws
```

#### For Azure Staging
```bash
cd azure
```

### 3. Initialize Staging Environment

```bash
make init staging
```

### 4. Configure Staging Environment Variables

#### AWS Staging (.env in aws/staging/lambdas/core/)
```env
COOKIE_SECRET='staging-cookie-secret-secure-value'
SESSION_SECRET='staging-session-secret-secure-value'
CLOUD_PROVIDER='aws'
BUCKET_NAME='kainos-core-kfd-files-staging'
AUTH_CONFIG_FILE_NAME='auth'
PORT=3000
USE_LOCAL_SERVICES='false'
LOG_LEVEL='info'
BUCKET_NAME_FOR_FORM_FILES='kainos-core-form-files-staging'
BUCKET_REGION_FOR_FORM_FILES='eu-west-2'
FORM_SESSION_TABLE_NAME='Core_FormSessions_staging'
ALLOWED_ORIGIN='https://staging.kainoscore.example.com'
```

#### Azure Staging (.env in azure/staging/functions/core/)
```env
COOKIE_SECRET='staging-cookie-secret-secure-value'
SESSION_SECRET='staging-session-secret-secure-value'
AUTH_CONFIG_FILE_NAME='auth'
PORT=3000
USE_LOCAL_SERVICES='false'
LOG_LEVEL='info'
CLOUD_PROVIDER='azure'
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT='kainoscorestoragestagin'
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER='kfd-files'
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_FOR_FORM_FILES='kainosformfilesstaging'
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_FOR_FORM_FILES='submitted-forms'
AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT='https://kainos-core-cosmos-staging.documents.azure.com:443/'
AZURE_COSMOS_DATABASE='KainosCore'
FORM_SESSION_TABLE_NAME='FormSessions'
ALLOWED_ORIGIN='https://staging.kainoscore.example.com'
```

### 5. Run Security Validation

```bash
make checkov staging
```

Ensure all security checks pass before proceeding.

### 6. Plan Staging Infrastructure

```bash
make plan staging
```

Review the plan carefully:
- Verify resource naming includes "staging"
- Check security configurations
- Validate network settings
- Confirm monitoring setup

### 7. Apply Staging Infrastructure

```bash
make apply staging
```

**Note**: This may require manual approval depending on your CI/CD configuration.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Components

### AWS Staging Resources

Refer to [AWS Terraform modules](../../aws/modules/) for detailed specifications.

**Enhanced Features vs Development:**
- Increased Lambda memory and timeout settings
- Enhanced CloudWatch monitoring with alarms
- Cross-AZ redundancy where applicable
- Enhanced security groups and NACLs
- Backup and disaster recovery configurations

### Azure Staging Resources

Refer to [Azure Terraform modules](../../azure/modules/) for detailed specifications.

**Enhanced Features vs Development:**
- Premium Function App plans for better performance
- Enhanced Application Insights monitoring
- Geo-redundant storage options
- Enhanced network security groups
- Backup and disaster recovery configurations

## üß™ Testing Procedures

### 1. Smoke Tests

```bash
# Run basic connectivity tests
curl -f https://staging.kainoscore.example.com/health

# Test core functionality
npm run test:smoke:staging
```

### 2. Integration Tests

```bash
# Run full integration test suite
npm run test:integration:staging

# Test file upload functionality
npm run test:upload:staging
```

### 3. Performance Tests

```bash
# Run load tests
npm run test:load:staging

# Monitor performance metrics
# Check CloudWatch/Application Insights dashboards
```

### 4. User Acceptance Testing

1. **Deploy Test Data**
   - Upload sample KFD files
   - Configure test user accounts
   - Set up test scenarios

2. **UAT Checklist**
   - [ ] Form rendering functionality
   - [ ] File upload and processing
   - [ ] User authentication flows
   - [ ] Data persistence and retrieval
   - [ ] Error handling and recovery

3. **Stakeholder Sign-off**
   - Provide access to staging environment
   - Collect feedback and issues
   - Document any required changes

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### AWS Monitoring Setup

**CloudWatch Dashboards:**
- Application performance metrics
- Infrastructure health metrics
- Error rates and response times
- Resource utilization

**CloudWatch Alarms:**
- Lambda function errors
- High response times
- Storage capacity warnings
- Security event notifications

### Azure Monitoring Setup

**Application Insights:**
- Application performance monitoring
- User behavior analytics
- Dependency tracking
- Custom telemetry

**Azure Monitor:**
- Infrastructure metrics
- Log analytics
- Alert rules
- Action groups for notifications

## üîí Security Considerations

### Enhanced Security Features

1. **Network Security**
   - Private subnets for sensitive resources
   - Network ACLs and security groups
   - VPC/VNet peering restrictions

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Key rotation policies
   - Access logging and auditing

3. **Identity and Access**
   - Least privilege access policies
   - Multi-factor authentication requirements
   - Regular access reviews

### Security Validation

```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
make checkov staging

# Validate network configurations
# Review IAM/RBAC policies
# Check encryption settings
```

## üîÑ Staging Workflow

### Automated Deployment (via GitHub Actions)

1. **Trigger**: PR merged to main branch
2. **Security Scan**: Automated Checkov validation
3. **Plan**: Terraform plan generation
4. **Approval**: Manual approval required
5. **Deploy**: Terraform apply execution
6. **Test**: Automated test suite execution
7. **Notify**: Stakeholder notification

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Validate configuration
make check

# 2. Plan changes
make plan staging

# 3. Apply changes (with approval)
make apply staging

# 4. Run tests
npm run test:staging

# 5. Notify stakeholders
# Send notification with staging URL and test results
```

## üö® Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback

If automated tests fail:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
terraform apply -var="rollback=true" staging

# Or destroy and recreate from last known good state
make destroy staging
git checkout <last-good-commit>
make apply staging
```

### Manual Rollback

1. **Identify Issue**
   - Check monitoring dashboards
   - Review error logs
   - Assess impact scope

2. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous Terraform state
   terraform state pull > current-state.backup
   terraform apply -var="version=previous" staging
   ```

3. **Validate Rollback**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify functionality
   - Notify stakeholders
