The Lambda Terraform Module is a reusable and flexible module designed to simplify the deployment and management of AWS Lambda functions. It allows you to configure essential settings such as function name, runtime, handler, memory size, and environment variables dynamically through input variables. The module also supports optional alias creation for version management and integrates with CloudWatch for logging with customizable retention and encryption settings. By leveraging this module, you can efficiently provision multiple Lambda functions across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with consistent configurations, enhancing scalability and maintainability in your infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows.
